Quick Start Guide
=================

If you're new to Scout, this is the right place to get started. Steps for running a Scout analysis from start to finish are listed below; additional guidance on certain steps can be found in linked tutorials.

.. _qsg-installation-step:

1. Setup Scout and prerequisites
--------------------------------

`Download the latest version of Scout`_ and follow the :ref:`install-guide` to configure the programs required for Scout to run.

.. _qsg-create-ecm-step:

2. Create new ECM definition(s) (optional)
------------------------------------------

Open the |html-filepath| ./ecm_definitions |html-fp-end| folder to browse through the default set of ECM definition files; follow :ref:`tuts-1` to add your own ECM definition(s).

.. _qsg-cmdline-step:

3. Open the command line interface
----------------------------------

Open a Terminal window (Mac) [#]_ or command prompt (Windows) [#]_ and navigate to the Scout project directory (shown with the example location |html-filepath| ./Documents/projects/scout-0.1\ |html-fp-end| â€“ substitute the path to your Scout directory) by entering the following command line argument:

**Windows** ::

   cd Documents\projects\scout-0.1

**Mac** ::

   cd Documents/projects/scout-0.1

.. _qsg-ecm-prep-step:

4. Prepare ECMs for analysis
----------------------------

Enter the following command line argument (see :ref:`tuts-2` for additional guidance):

**Windows** ::

   py -3 ecm_prep.py

**Mac** ::

   python3 ecm_prep.py

.. Note::
   Only new or edited ECM definitions are updated in this step.

.. _qsg-modify-active-ecm-step:

5. Modify active list of ECMs (optional)
----------------------------------------

Enter the following command line argument (see :ref:`tuts-ecm-list-setup` for additional guidance):

**Windows** ::

   py -3 run_setup.py

**Mac** ::

   python3 run_setup.py

.. _qsg-run-analysis-step:

6. Run analysis on active ECMs
------------------------------

Enter the following command line argument (see :ref:`tuts-analysis` for additional guidance):

**Windows** ::

   py -3 run.py

**Mac** ::

   python3 run.py

.. _qsg-view-results-step:

7. View results plots and data
------------------------------

Open the |html-filepath| ./results/plots |html-fp-end| folder to view output plots and access the underlying results data (see :ref:`tuts-results` for additional guidance).

Output plots are organized in folders by :ref:`adoption scenario <overview-adoption>` and :ref:`plotted metric of interest <overview-results>` (i.e., |html-filepath| ./results/plots/(adoption scenario)/(metric of interest)\ |html-fp-end|). Raw data for each adoption scenario's plots are stored in the XLSX files beginning with "Summary_Data."
