Scout is a software program that estimates the impacts of various energy conservation measures (ECMs) in the U.S. residential and commercial building sectors. Scout evaluates the energy savings, avoided CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, operating cost reductions, and cost-effectiveness (using several metrics) of each ECM under multiple technology adoption scenarios. These results are obtained for the entire U.S., and also broken out by climate zone, building class (i.e., new/existing, residential/commercial), and end use.

### Getting Started

Scout is currently a command line-based tool. Once you've installed the [necessary prerequisites](http://scout-bto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html#initial-setup), you can download Scout and run it on your computer. To download, click the "Clone or download" button and then click "Download ZIP."

Scout is free and open-source software and can be used by anyone, subject to the [license terms](https://github.com/trynthink/scout/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

### Documentation

Documentation for Scout is [available online](http://scout-bto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The documentation includes instructions for setting up a computer to run Scout, tutorials on how to use the components of Scout, a primer on the modeling approach, and reference materials for ECM definitions.

### Market Calculator

The [Market Calculator](https://trynthink.github.io/scout/calculator.html) is a web-based tool that allows users to explore the Scout baseline data. Based on user selections, the calculator yields total baseline U.S. energy use and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for one or several market segments, which can help users evaluate the national impact potential for an ECM of interest.

### Future Updates

You can track on-going development of Scout in this repository. If you find any errors in the model or opportunities for improvement, contribute to the issue tracker by [commenting on an existing issue](https://github.com/trynthink/scout/issues) or [submitting a new one](https://github.com/trynthink/scout/issues/new).
