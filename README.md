Welcome to the home of Scout. The code and databases here will eventually facilitate quantitative analysis of the energy and CO<sub>2</sub> impacts of novel residential and commercial building products, also known as "energy conservation measures" (ECMs). Stay tuned for updates!

### We are working on a web interface for Scout

Running a full Scout analysis requires a basic understanding of how to use a command line interface. To ensure greater accessibility of Scout ECM definitions and simulation results, we are currently developing a web-based interface for Scout.

The web interface is expected to allow users to browse through a database of existing ECM definitions, suggest edits to these definitions, and submit new ECMs for inclusion in the database. Users will also be able to view results from previous Scout analysis engine runs, and download Scout to run their own simulations locally.

### In the meantime, take a look at the (baseline) [Market Calculator](https://trynthink.github.io/scout/calculator.html)

The Market Calculator yields total baseline U.S. energy use and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for one or several market segments, which can help users frame the national impact potential for an ECM of interest.

### Scout's input data and analysis engine will continue to be updated

You can track on-going development of Scout in this repository. If you find any errors in the model or opportunities for improvement, contribute to the issue tracker by [commenting on an existing issue](https://github.com/trynthink/scout/issues) or [submitting a new one](https://github.com/trynthink/scout/issues/new).

### Documentation is now available

Documentation for Scout is now [available online](http://scout-bto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). As with the analysis engine, the documentation is being actively updated with expanded details, additional illustrations, and new reference materials and tutorials.
